    <p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.</p>

    <p>
        The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water
        for
        longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing
        method
        in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh,
        "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is
        used.
        Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is
        adjustable,
        then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses
        less
        ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless used to grind
        very
        large amounts as in a commercial operation. A fine grind allows the most efficient extraction but coffee ground
        too
        finely will slow down filtration or screening.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater
        surface area exposed to oxygen. Many
        coffee drinkers grind the beans themselves immediately before brewing
    </p>

    <p>
        A device that is used to grind whole coffee beans into a suitable size for
        brewing. Manually operated coffee grinders require that a hand crank be
        turned in order to move blades that grind the coffee beans. Electric models
        are available that do the job more quickly and may be more convenient to use.
    </p>

    <p>
        The grinder is a tool of great importance in extracting the aroma and
        taste from coffee beans, allowing for the brewing of delicious, high
        quality coffee. In most cases, the grinder is the crucial aspect to
        the equation, though most people believe that the coffee machine is
        the star of the show.

    <div> There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Burr-grinding</li> <br>
        <a href="./images/coffee-bur-grinder.jpg"><img src="./images/coffee-bur-grinder.jpg" alt="Burr-grinding"></a>
        <p>
            Burr mills use two revolving abrasive elements, such as wheels or conical grinding
            elements, between which the coffee beans are crushed or "torn" with little frictional heating.
            The process of squeezing and crushing of the beans releases the coffee's oils, which are then
            more easily extracted during the infusion process with hot water, making the coffee taste richer
            and smoother.
        </p>

        <p>
            Both manually and electrically powered mills are available. These mills grind the coffee to
            a fairly uniform size determined by the separation of the two abrasive surfaces between which
            the coffee is ground; the uniform grind produces a more even extraction when brewed, without
            excessively fine particles that clog filters.
        </p>

        <p>
            These mills offer a wide range of grind settings, making them suitable to grind coffee for various
            brewing systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others. Many burr grinders,
            including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required
            for the preparation of Turkish coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burr grinders are of two types - conical burrs and flat wheel burrs. Both of them grind coffee
            bean consistently and with uniform size. Almost every burr coffee grinder grinds at low noise,
            offer large hopper for storing whole coffee bean, easy to use with portafilter for espresso grind,
            body made with stainless steel or ceramic with modern design as well as slow operating system
            ensures fine grind all the time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Chopping</li> <br>
        <a href="./images/coffee-chopping.jpg"><img src="./images/coffee-chopping.jpg" alt="coffee-chopping"></a>

        <p>
            The first step is to toss a small amount (try 1/4 cup) of beans into the blender.
            Pulse the beans on medium speed to break them down to your preferred grind. Using
            a blender generally creates a coarser grind, great for brewing with a drip coffee
            maker, French press or cold-brew coffee maker.

        </p>

        <p>
            Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed
            (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade grinder designed specifically for
            coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender. Devices of this sort
            are cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and will
            produce particles of widely varying sizes, while ideally all particles
            should have the same size, appropriate for the method of brewing.
            Moreover, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process,
            which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to batch.
        </p>

        <p>Blade grinders create “coffee dust” that can clog up sieves in espresso machines and French
            presses, and are best suited for drip coffee makers. They are not recommended for grinding
            coffee for use with pump espresso machines</p>

        <p>
            Moreover, coffee grinder burrs result in a uniform grind which makes perfect extraction much
            easier, resulting in a bold, strong, and smooth flavor. On the other hand, a food processor uses
            sharp blades to cut through food. These blades will pulverize the beans, giving you a somewhat
            coarser grind.
        </p>

        <br>
        <li>Pounding</li><br>

        <p>
            Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee require that the grounds be almost powdery
            in fineness, finer than can be achieved by most burr grinders. Pounding the
            beans with a mortar and pestle can pulverise the coffee finely enough.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Roller grinding</li><br>

        <p>
            In a roller grinder, the beans are ground between pairs of corrugated rollers. A roller grinder
            produces a more even grind size distribution and heats the ground coffee less than other grinding
            methods. However, due to their size and cost, roller grinders are used exclusively by commercial
            and industrial scale coffee producers.
        </p>

        <p>
            A roller mill grinds coffee by passing it between a pair of grooved steel cylinders that rotate
            against each other, forcing coffee through the gap in between. They can grind huge volumes of
            coffee, typically measured in kg/hr, which makes them essential for industrial applications.
        </p>

        <p>Roller mills can also produce relatively spherical particles of coffee, with a very defined
            and narrow particle size distribution, which is part of the reason that espresso pods can
            produce such high extractions in a short time (J. Hoffmann, 2015). Multi-stage roller
            mills can also be configured to produce specific multi-modal particle size distributions,
