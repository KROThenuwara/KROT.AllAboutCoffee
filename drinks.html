            Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk,
            using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate
            powder.It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with
            a thicker layer of microfoam.</p>

        <p>The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,
            and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added
            in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical
            appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a
            result of a long evolution of the drink.</p>

        <p>The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the 18th century, on a
            version that included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian
            cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out
            of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste and other Italian areas in Austria-Hungary
            through the Kapuziner coffee in the early 20th century. The drink spread from
            Trieste, the main coffee port in Central Europe, throughout Italy, especially
            after World War I and later worldwide, and can be found at a number of
            establishments</p>

        <p>Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed
            of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk.
            Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The espresso is
            poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk,
            which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine
            steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be
            decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.
        </p>

        <p>In a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffee houses in
            the United States, the total of espresso and milk/foam make up between
            approximately 150 and 180 ml (5 and 6 imp fl oz; 5 and 6 US fl oz). Commercial
            coffee restaurant chains in the US more often serve the cappuccino as a 360 ml
            (13 imp fl oz; 12 US fl oz) drink or larger. In Italy, a cappuccino consists
            of 25 ml (1 imp fl oz; 1 US fl oz) of espresso; the rest of the cup is filled
            with equal parts of milk and foam. Outside of Italy, the ratios of espresso,
            milk, and foam typically equal 1/3 each.</p>

        <h3>Latte</h3>

        <a href="./images/latte.jpg"> <img src="./images/latte.jpg" alt="latte"></a>
        <p>Caffè latte, often shortened to just latte in English, is a coffee beverage
            of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk. Variants include the
            chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another beverage base
            such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric, or rooibos;
            other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.</p>

        <p>The term comes from the Italian caffellatte or caffè latte, from caffè e
            latte, literally "coffee and milk"; in English orthography either or both
            words sometimes have an accent on the final e (a hyperforeignism in the
            case of *latté, or to indicate it is pronounced, not the more-common silent
            final e of English). In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term café au
            lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk.
            In France, café latte is from the original name of the beverage (caffè
            latte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a
            "latte" is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee or
            (in Austria) Wiener Melange.</p>

        <p>Coffee and milk have been part of European cuisine since the
            seventeenth century. Caffè e latte, Milchkaffee, café au lait,
            and café con leche are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking
            coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public cafés in
            Europe and the USA seem to have no mention of the terms until the
            twentieth century, although Kapuziner is mentioned in Austrian
            coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the second half of 1700s
            as "coffee with cream, spices, and sugar" (being the origin of
            the Italian cappuccino).</p>

        <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term caffè e
            latte was first used in English in 1867 by William Dean Howells
            in his essay "Italian Journeys".[6] Kenneth Davids maintain
            s that "...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe
            for generations, but the (commercial) caffè version of
            this drink is an American invention".[7][dubious – discuss]
            The French term café au lait was used in cafés in several
            countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward,
            however, the term café crème was used in France for coffee
            with milk or crea</p>

        <h3>Macchiato</h3>

        <a href="./images/caffe macchiato.jpg"><img src="./images/caffe macchiato.jpg" alt="caffe-macchiato"
                id="cm"></a>

        <p>Caffè macchiato , sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso
            coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian,
            macchiato means "stained" or "spotted", so the literal translation of
            caffè macchiato is "stained coffee" or "marked coffee".</p>

        <p>The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink
            made with those ingredients. The intent is that the milk moderates, rather
            than overwhelms, the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetnes
            s. The drink is typically prepared by pouring a small amount of steamed
            milk directly into a single shot of espresso.[4] One recipe calls for 5–10 g
            (1–2 teaspoons) of milk heated to 60–66 °C (140–150 °F).
        </p>

        <p>The origin of the name "macchiato" stems from baristas needing to show the serving
            waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk
            in it; the latter was "marked". The idea is reflected in the Portuguese name for
            the drink: café pingado, meaning coffee with a drop.</p>

        <h3>Iced Coffee</h3>

        <a href="./images/ice coffee.jpg"><img src="./images/ice coffee.jpg" alt="iced-coffee"></a>

        <p>Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either
            by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then
            serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In
            hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as
            they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved
            sugar in water.</p>

        <p>Pre-packaged iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several countries,
            though without ice. Iced coffee is also regularly available in most coffee
            shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher strength than normal
            coffee, since it is diluted by the melting ice.
        </p>

        <p>Mazagran, a cold, sweetened coffee beverage that originated in Algeria
            circa 1840, has been described by locals as "the original iced coffee".
            It was prepared with coffee syrup and cold water.
            Frozen coffee beverages, similar to slush, are
            documented in the 19th century. Similar is the Italian granita al caffè.
            Coffee brewed then chilled with ice, called "iced coffee", appears in menus
            and recipes in the late 19th century.
            Iced coffee was popularized by a marketing campaign of the Joint Coffee
            Trade Publicity Committee of the United States in 1920. Much later,
            it was marketed by chain outlets like Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks
        </p>

        <p>Iced coffee may be served already chilled, or poured hot over ice. Because
            sugar does not dissolve readily into cold liquids, it must be added either
            directly to the hot base, or to the finished product in the form of syrup.</p>

        <p>Long popular among coffee enthusiasts in the U.S., iced coffee is quickly gaining
            popularity among the general consumer audience as evidenced by the fact that it
            is available in mass food franchises and sold bottled in grocery stores. Iced
            coffee is prepared many different ways, including cold brew coffee and chilled
            conventional coffe</p>

        <h3>Frappé</h3>

        <a href="./images/frappe.jpg"><img src="./images/frappe.jpg" alt="frappe"></a>

        <p>The name frappé comes from French, where it describes drinks chilled with
            ice. Beginning in the 19th century, a variety of cold coffee drinks named
            café frappé (à la glace) are documented, some similar to slushes,
            others more like iced coffee.</p>

        <p>A frappé coffee, Greek frappé, Nescafé frappé, or just frappé
            is a Greek iced coffee drink made
            from instant coffee (generally, spray-dried Nescafé), water, sugar,
            and milk. The word is often written frappe (without an accent).
            The frappé was invented through experimentation by Dimitris Vakondios,
            a Nescafe representative, in 1957 in Thessaloniki. Frappés are among
            the most popular forms of coffee in Greece and Cyprus and have become a
            hallmark of postwar outdoor Greek coffee culture.</p>

        <p>The Greek version of café frappé, using instant coffee, was invented in 1957
            at the Thessaloniki International Fair. A representative of the Nestlé company,
            Giannis Dritsas, was exhibiting a new product for children, a chocolate beverage
            produced instantly by mixing it with milk and shaking it in a shaker. Dritsas'
            employee Dimitris Vakondios was looking for a way to have his usual instant
            coffee during his break but could not find any hot water, so, he mixed the
            coffee with cold water and ice cubes in a shaker</p>

        <p>This improvised experiment established the frappé which quickly grew in popularity
            in Greece. Nestlè capitalized on the drink with intense marketing campaigns
            in the 1980s that broadened the drink's popularity and left the brand name
            Nescafé inextricably linked with the frappé. While today the drink is
            usually simply called a 'frappé' in Greece, in the past it was often
            called a 'Nescafé frappé'.
        </p>

        <p>A frappé can be made with a cocktail shaker or, more commonly today, with an
            electric milk frother or milkshake machine. First, instant coffee
            (traditionally Nescafe), sugar (optionally), and a little water are shaken
            or blended together until a thick foam is made. This is poured into the
            serving glass and ice cubes, cold water, and, optionally, milk (traditionally
            evaporated milk) are added to it. The drink is almost always served with a
            drinking straw, as the thick foam which forms on top is considered
            unpleasantly bitter by many.

        <h3>Flat white</h3>

        <a href="./images/flat-white.jpg"><img src="./images/flat-white.jpg" alt="flat-white"></a>

        <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam
            (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency).
            It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam,
            therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more
            velvety in consistency allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while
            being supported by the milk.

        <p>A flat white is generally served in a ceramic cup with saucer. Milk is frothed
            and foamy as it would be for a latte but held back to around 20 mm (0.79 in)
            of microfoam, creating a meniscus. Differences in the size of the foam layer
            differ between regions, with some preferring as little as 1mm. Key to the
            beverage is the crema being coaxed into the meniscus resulting in a uniform
            dark brown colour across the top of the beverage. Allowing the beverage to
            stand before drinking enhances the experience as the meniscus thickens and
            adds texture to each sip, resulting in distinct sip rings/tide marks as
            the beverage is consumed.

        <p>According to a survey of industry commentators a flat white has several defining
            characteristics, chief among which is a thin layer of velvety microfoam
            (hence the 'flat' in flat white), as opposed to the significantly thicker
            layer of foam in a traditional cappuccino.

        <p>There is a reference to a "flat white coffee" in the 1962 British film Danger
            by My Side, although it is not clear that this refers to the modern drink.
            Episode 123 of Australian soap opera The Young Doctors a character asks for
            two flat whites in the restaurant Bunny's Place - set in Sydney, this was
            filmed / broadcast in 1976–1977.[citation needed] The earliest documented
            references to the modern beverage date back to Australia in the mid-1980s.
            A review of the Sydney café, Miller's Treat in May 1983 referred to their
            "flat white coffee". Another Sydney newspaper article in April 1984
            satirised a vogue for caffe latte, stating that "caffe latte translates
            as flat white". At Moors Espresso Bar in Sydney, Alan Preston added the
            beverage to his permanent menu in 1985. Preston claimed he had imported
            the idea to Sydney from his native Queensland, where cafés in the 1960s
            and 1970s had frequently offered "White Coffee – flat". Other documented
            references include the Parliament House cafeteria in Canberra putting up
            a sign in January 1985 saying "flat white only" during a seasonal problem
            with milk cows that prevented the milk froth from forming.
