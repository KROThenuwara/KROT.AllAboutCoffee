    <h2>Brewing</h2> <br>

    <p>
        In percolation, the water passes through the coffee grounds, gaining soluble compounds to form coffee.
        Insoluble
        compounds remain within the coffee filter.
        Coffee can be brewed in several different ways, but these methods fall into four main groups depending on
        how
        the
        water is introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through boiling), infusion (through steeping),
        gravitational
        feed (used with percolators and in drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as with espresso).
        Brewed coffee, if kept hot, will deteriorate rapidly in flavor, and reheating such coffee tends to give it a
        "muddy"
        flavour, as some compounds that impart flavor to coffee are destroyed if this is done. Even at room
        temperature,
        deterioration will occur; however, if kept in an oxygen-free environment it can last almost indefinitely at
        room
        temperature, and sealed containers of brewed coffee are sometimes commercially available in food stores in
        America
        or Europe, with refrigerated bottled coffee drinks being commonly available at convenience stores and
        grocery
        stores
        in the United States. Canned coffee is particularly popular in Japan and South Korea.

        <h3>Boiling</h3>
        <br>

        <p>
            Boiling, or decoction, was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s and is still used in some
            Nordic and Middle Eastern countries. The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C (205 °F), which is
            just below
            boiling, while the bitter acids are released when the water has reached boiling point.
        </p>

        <p>
            The simplest method is to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and let cool while the
            grounds
            sink
            to the bottom. This is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used in parts of
            Indonesia.
            This method, known as "mud coffee" in the Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a
            mud-like
            sludge at the bottom of the cup, allows for extremely simple preparation, but drinkers then have to be
            careful
            if
            they want to avoid drinking grounds either from this layer or floating at the surface of the coffee, which
            can
            be
            avoided by dribbling cold water onto the "floaters" from the back of a spoon. If the coffee beans are not
            ground
            finely enough, the grounds do not sink.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Cowboy coffee" is made by heating coarse grounds with water in a pot, letting the grounds settle and
            pouring
            off
            the liquid to drink, sometimes filtering it to remove fine grounds. While the name suggests that this method
            was
            used by cowboys, presumably on the trail around a campfire, it is used by others; some people prefer this
            method.
        </p>

        <h5>The above methods are sometimes used with hot milk instead of water.</h5>

        <p>
            Turkish coffee (aka Arabic coffee, etc.), a very early method of making coffee, is used in
            the Middle East,
            North
            Africa, East Africa, Turkey, Greece, the Balkans, and Russia. Very finely ground coffee, optionally sugar,
            and
            water
            are placed in a narrow-topped pot, called an cezve (Turkish), kanaka (Egyptian), briki (Greek), džezva
            (Štokavian)
            or turka (Russian) and brought to the boil then immediately removed from the heat. It may be very briefly
            brought to
            the boil two or three times. Turkish coffee is sometimes flavored with cardamom, particularly in Arab
            countries.
            The
            resulting strong coffee, with foam on the top and a thick layer of grounds at the bottom, is drunk from
            small
            cups.

        <h3>Steeping</h3> <br>

        <p>
            A cafetière, or French press, is a tall, narrow cylinder with a plunger that includes a metal or nylon fine
            mesh
            filter. The grounds are placed in the cylinder, and off-the- boil water is then poured into it. The coffee
            and hot
            water are left in the cylinder for a few minutes (typically 4–7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently
            pushed down,
            leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, allowing the coffee to be poured out while the filter
            retains the
            grounds. Depending on the type of filter, it is important to pay attention to the grind of the coffee beans,
            though
            a rather coarse grind is almost always called for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malaysian and some Caribbean and South American styles of coffee are often brewed using a "sock," which is
            actually
            a simple muslin bag, shaped like a filter, into which coffee is loaded, then steeped in hot water. This
            method is
            especially suitable for use with local-brew coffees in Malaysia, primarily of the varieties Robusta and
            Liberica
            which are often strong-flavored, allowing the ground coffee in the sock to be reused.
        </p>

        <p>
            The amount of time that the water is in contact with the coffee grounds is another important
            flavor factor. In a drip system, the contact time should be approximately 5 minutes. If you are
            making your coffee using a French Press, the contact time should be 2-4 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Steeping is a process of creating coffee by adding ground coffee to hot water. It is one way
            to experience immersion brewing. Steeped coffee offers complexity in flavors as the coffee grounds
            remain in the hot water for more extended periods compared to the other coffee preparation methods.

        <h3>Filtration methods</h3> <br>

        <a href="./images/coffee filter.jpg"><img src="./images/coffee filter.jpg" alt="coffee-filtering"></a>


        <p>
            Drip brew coffee, also known as filtered or American coffee, is made by letting hot water drip onto coffee
            grounds
            held in a coffee filter surrounded by a filter holder or brew basket. Drip brew makers can be simple filter
            holder
            types manually filled with hot water, or they can use automated systems as found in the popular electric
            drip
            coffee-maker. Strength varies according to the ratio of water to coffee and the fineness of the grind, but
            is
            typically weaker than espresso, though the final product contains more caffeine. By convention, regular
            coffee
            brewed by this method is served by some restaurants in a brown or black pot (or a pot with a brown or black
            handle),
            while decaffeinated coffee is served in an orange pot (or a pot with an orange handle).
        </p>
        <p>
            The common electric percolator, which was in almost universal use in the United States prior to the 1970s,
            and is
            still popular in some households today, differs from the pressure percolator described above. It uses the
            pressure
            of the boiling water to force it to a chamber above the grounds, but relies on gravity to pass the water
            down
            through the grounds, where it then repeats the process until shut off by an internal timer. Some coffee
            aficionados
            hold the coffee produced in low esteem because of this multiple-pass process. Others prefer gravity
            percolation and
            claim it delivers a richer cup of coffee in comparison to drip brewing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another variation is cold brew coffee, sometimes known as "cold press." Cold water is poured over coffee
            grounds and
            allowed to steep for eight to twenty-four hours. The coffee is then filtered, usually through a very thick
            filter,
            removing all particles. This process produces a very strong concentrate which can be stored in a
            refrigerated,
            airtight container for up to eight weeks. The coffee can then be prepared for drinking by adding hot water
            to the
            concentrate at a water-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 3:1, but can be adjusted to the drinker's
            preference.
            The coffee prepared by this method is very low in acidity with a smooth taste, and is often preferred by
            those with
            sensitive stomachs. Others, however, feel this method strips coffee of its bold flavor and character. Thus,
            this
            method is not common, and there are few appliances designed for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount of coffee used affects both the strength and the flavor of the brew in a typical drip-brewing
            filtration-based coffee maker. The softer flavors come out of the coffee first and the more bitter flavors
            only
            after some time, so a large brew will tend to be both stronger and more bitter. This can be modified by
            stopping the
            filtration after a planned time and then adding hot water to the brew instead of waiting for all the water
            to pass
            through the grounds.

        <h3>Pressure</h3>
        <br>
        <a href="./images/coffee pressure.jpg"><img src="./images/coffee pressure.jpg" alt="pressure"></a>

        <p>
            Espresso is made by forcing hot water at 91–95 °C (195–204 °F) under a pressure of between eight and
            eighteen bars
            (800–1800 kPa, 116–261 psi), through a lightly packed matrix, called a "puck," of finely ground coffee. The
            30–60 cc
            (1–2 oz.) beverage is served in demitasse cups; sugar is often added. It is consumed during the day at cafes
            and
            from street vendors, or after an evening meal. It is the basis for many coffee drinks. It is one of the most
            concentrated forms of coffee regularly consumed, with a distinctive flavor provided by crema, a layer of
            flavorful
            emulsified oils in the form of a colloidal foam floating on the surface, which is produced by the high
            pressure.
            Espresso is more viscous than other forms of brewed coffee.
            They are ground much finer, producing a texture more like a powder than the sandy grain of drip
            coffee. And the brewing process uses much hotter water at a much higher pressure, which creates a
            very different brew that extracts more of the flavor of the beans.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two reasons that 9 bars of pressure seemed to be the sweet spot for coffee extraction.
            Our experiments indicate that the forces between the pressure of water and the resistance of the
            puck were balanced at 9 bars.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short, it's a combination of the amount of force the water is pushed into your puck and the
            resistance produced by the coffee puck. The water pressure is what pulls the oils from the coffee
            grounds to create the desired taste profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            turns an otherwise good shot into something that's overwhelmingly bitter,
            even for seasoned espresso lovers. Not to mention the wrist strain involved! If you
            continuously tamp too hard, you're likely to cause sore wrists from the excess pressure.
